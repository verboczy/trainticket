# trainticket
This repository contains an implementation of a train ticket automata. I implemented it by a specification, also written by me.

This implementation was used for trying model-based testing tools on it. These tools were [GraphWalker](http://graphwalker.github.io/) and [4Test](https://4test.io/).

## Prerequisites
+ Java 1.8
+ Maven
