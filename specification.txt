Specification of train-ticket booking automata
----------------------------------------------
----------------------------------------------

In the beginning, the automata is waiting for 
user input. It is possible to print a ticket 
bought on the internet previously, or purchase 
a ticket on the spot.

In case of the internet ticket, the user 
has to type a 10 digit code. If it is valid, 
which means the code can be found in the ticket 
code database, then the machine prints the 
ticket and writes "Thank you for choosing 
the railways!" to the output and deletes the code
from the database. Then it returns to the waiting 
state.
If the database doesn't contain the code, then 
it writes "Invalid code" to the output, and 
waits for the code again.

In case of ticket purchase, the user has to 
give the following details:
- the initial station,
- the destination,
- the time of departure.
The user may return to the main interface between 
these steps.
If all of the above three information is accepted, 
then the user has to choose the type of payment.

Possible choices of payment:
- cash,
- credit card.

In case of cash, the machine inspects the 
banknote(s) or coin(s). When it has the 
proper amount of money it prints the 
ticket and writes "Thank you for choosing 
the railways!" to the output, and returns the 
change if needed. Then it returns to the 
waiting state.

In case of credit card, the user has to type in 
her credit card's number. This number is checked, 
then the transaction takes place. If everything 
was successful, then it prints the ticket and 
writes "Thank you for choosing the railways!" to 
the output, and returns to the main interface.
If something went wrong the user has to choose 
the payment type again.
